Public showing of private development. Or said another way, I'm doing all this development on a private repository, but to the outside world it looks like playing Xbox all day (I don't have one)

We'll see how this goes...

## Initial Development pre 1.0.0

- Updated to the latest laravel/laravel. v4 final is due out in a little over a week
- Removed the `"nesbot/Carbon": "*"` and added the `"jasonlewis/expressive-date": "1.*"` package.
- Composer.json update. Had `"laravel/framework": "4.0.*",` under `"require"` and `"require-dev"`
- Testing and applying Cartalyst Sentry, Sentry-Social, and API.
- Created this `readme.md` booyah! Commit that, Yo.
- Been some major leaps forward! Stand by!
-
