Public showing of private development. Or said another way, I'm doing all this development on a private repository, but to the outside world it looks like playing Xbox all day (I don't have one)

We'll see how this goes...

## Initial Development pre 1.0.0

- Testing and applying Cartalyst Sentry, Sentry-Social, and API.
- Created this `readme.md` booyah! Commit that, Yo.
